    Staying Safe on the Dark Web: Providing tips and strategies for maintaining personal safety while browsing the dark web.
    """
    let l2 = """
    Browsing the dark web comes with inherent risks, and it\'s crucial to prioritize personal safety and protect your identity and information. Here are some tips and strategies for staying safe while accessing the dark web:
    """

    let l3 = """
    1. Use Secure and Isolated Systems
    """
    let l3_desc = """
    Access the dark web from a dedicated device or virtual machine that is separate from your everyday browsing activities. This helps mitigate the risk of cross-contamination of personal information.
    """

    let l4 = """
    2. Tor Browser
    """
    let l4_desc = """
    Utilize the Tor Browser for accessing the dark web. It is specifically designed to provide anonymity and privacy. Keep the browser and its components up to date to benefit from security patches and improvements.
    """
